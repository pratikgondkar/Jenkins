What you will do:
In this lab we will create a Jenkins Scripted Pipeline for CI:
# Create a Jenkins Scripted Pipeline that will kick start the CI process if a commit is made.
# Add a Stage in pipeline to perform to Code stability. checkstyle, sonarQube
# Add a Stage in pipeline to perform code quality analysis. PMD
# Add a Stage in pipeline to perform code coverage analysis. cobertura
# Add a Stage in pipeline to generate report for code quality & analysis. 
Try to create pipeline for other project with as minimum code changes as possible.

node {
    stage('Code Checkout') {
        git branch: 'java7', url: 'https://github.com/opstree/spring3hibernate.git'
    }
    stage('Code Stability') {
        def mvnHome = tool 'maven3'
        sh 'mvn checkstyle:checkstyle'
        sh 'mvn findbugs:findbugs'
    }
    stage('Code Quality') {
        def mvnHome = tool 'maven3'
        sh 'mvn pmd:pmd'
    }
    stage('Code Coverage') {
        def mvnHome = tool 'maven3'
        sh 'mvn cobertura:cobertura'
    }
    stage('Publish  Reports') {
        cobertura(coberturaReportFile: 'target/site/cobertura/coverage.xml')
        recordIssues(tools: [pmdParser(), findBugs(useRankAsPriority: true), checkStyle()])
    }
}
